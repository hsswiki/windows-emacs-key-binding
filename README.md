# Use Emacs and Mac-like Key Bindings on Windows PC

This software brings Emacs key bindings (like cursor movement) and Mac system shortcuts (such as media control) to Windows. See the header of [`EmacsKeyBinding.ahk`](EmacsKeyBinding.ahk) for detailed documentation.

Also, please feel free to take any snippets that you found useful from the [source code](EmacsKeyBinding.ahk) if you are familiar with the [AHK scripting language](https://www.autohotkey.com).

## Usage

On Windows, download and double-click the stand-alone pre-compiled all-good [`EmacsKeyBinding.exe`](EmacsKeyBinding.exe) to run the program in the background. An icon will appear in the system tray indicating its status: S for suspended, red color for paused, and otherwise normal. Kindly refer to the script documentation for what those status mean.

**Note that the download may be reported as unsafe by the browser since it's an unverified executable.** Rest assured. You can also download the [source code](EmacsKeyBinding.ahk) and compile it by yourself if you have AHK installed.
