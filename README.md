# Use Emacs and Mac-like Key Bindings on Windows PC

Usage: On Windows, download the pre-compiled [`EmacsKeyBinding.exe`](EmacsKeyBinding.exe) and double-click. An "H" icon will appear in the system tray when the software is running.

Note that it may be reported as unsafe by the browser since it's a stand-alone executable. Rest assured, it just meant to be portable. You can also download the [source code](EmacsKeyBinding.ahk) and compile it by yourself.

See the header of [`EmacsKeyBinding.ahk`](EmacsKeyBinding.ahk) for detailed documentation.
